"""Base class for complex concept transformers.

A *complex* concept is one that cannot be expressed as a mapping over a single
source table: it is computed from the output of other concepts, which the
pipeline has already harmonised and written as per-dataset parquet. This module
factors out everything such a concept shares regardless of what it computes —
resolving and scanning its dependencies, evaluating the subclass's
``transform``, attaching the MEDS columns and any configured extension columns,
and sinking the result to the concept's output directory.

Subclasses implement :meth:`BaseConceptTransformer.transform` and nothing else.
It receives dependency concepts keyed by (unversioned) name and returns a
LazyFrame of ``subject_id`` and ``time`` plus ``numeric_value`` and/or
``text_value``; both are filled in as null where the subclass does not produce
them. Keeping ``transform`` pure and I/O-free is deliberate — it makes the
computation testable on in-memory frames without a configured pipeline, and
keeps the plan lazy all the way to a single streaming ``sink_parquet``.
