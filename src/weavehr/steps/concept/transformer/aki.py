"""KDIGO acute kidney injury staging as windowed-concept transformers.

KDIGO stages AKI on two independent criteria — serum creatinine and urine
output — and takes the higher of the two. They are implemented here as two
separate concepts, :class:`AkiCreatinineTransformer` and
:class:`AkiUrineOutputTransformer`, with :class:`AkiTransformer` combining
them. Keeping them apart is not just tidiness: urine output is charted far
less reliably than creatinine and its availability differs sharply between
databases, so a great deal of published ICU work stages AKI on creatinine
alone. Splitting lets a study select its criterion, lets the combined stage
fall back cleanly to whichever criterion a dataset actually supports, and
makes the difference between the two measurable rather than hidden inside one
score.

Both criteria are graded in continuous time at every contributing measurement,
so a stage is a step function over the stay rather than a value per calendar
day. Two departures from the guideline text are worth stating:

- *Baseline* is the lowest creatinine in the preceding ``baseline_window``
  (7 days by default), the usual operationalisation where a premorbid value is
  unavailable. Early in a stay that window is mostly empty and the baseline is
  effectively the admission value, so AKI present on admission is not
  detectable — a known limitation of every retrospective implementation, not
  of this one.
- The paediatric criterion (eGFR < 35 mL/min/1.73m^2 in patients under 18) is
  not implemented.

    against) and as the minimum over ``acute_window`` (against which the
    absolute 0.3 mg/dL rise is measured). The two windows are separate in the
    guideline and must stay separate here — a slow rise over a week is a ratio
    criterion, a 0.3 mg/dL jump only counts inside 48 hours.

    The absolute stage-3 threshold (creatinine reaching 4.0 mg/dL) is gated on
    the patient also meeting a stage-1 criterion, per the guideline footnote,
    so that stable chronic kidney disease does not stage as AKI. Set
    ``require_acute_rise=False`` for the ungated reading used by some
    implementations, which will raise sensitivity at the cost of staging
    unchanged chronic elevation as stage 3.

    continuously below, and a window averaging under the threshold need not
