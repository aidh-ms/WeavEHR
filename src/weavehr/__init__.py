"""
WeavEHR: A Python framework for extracting and analyzing ICU time series data.

This package provides tools for extracting, preprocessing, and analyzing ICU time
series data from diverse datasets (MIMIC, eICU, etc.). It converts heterogeneous
ICU data into the standardized MEDS (Medical Event Data Standard) format, enabling
reproducible research workflows.

Key Features:
- Support for multiple ICU data sources (MIMIC, eICU, custom datasets)
- Declarative YAML-based configuration for data extraction
- Export to MEDS format for standardized analysis
- Fully offline operation for medical data privacy compliance
- Modular and extensible architecture

Main Modules:
- callbacks: Data transformation callbacks for LazyFrames
- config: Configuration management and registry system
- storage: Project, dataset, and workspace management
- steps: Processing steps (extraction, concept, sharding)
- utils: Utility functions and helpers

Usage:
```python
from pathlib import Path

from weavehr import WeavEHRProject, ExtractionStep


config_path = Path.cwd() / "config"
project_path = Path.cwd() / "output" / "project"

# Create a new WeavEHR project
with WeavEHRProject(project_path) as project:
    # Load and run an extraction step
    extraction_step = ExtractionStep.load(project, config_path / "extraction.yml")
    extraction_step.run()
```
