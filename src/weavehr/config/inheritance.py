"""Dataset configuration inheritance across versions and variants.

A dataset version directory (``configs/datasets/<dataset>/<version>/``) may
contain an ``extends.yml`` marker that references another version as its base:

```yaml
dataset: eicu-crd
version: "2.0"
```

Configuration files in the version's subdirectories (``tables/``,
``mappings/``) are then resolved against the base, like a diff applied on top
of a reference version:

- Files that exist only in the base are inherited unchanged.
- Files that exist in both are deep-merged: mappings are merged recursively
  with the extending file taking precedence, while lists and scalar values
  are replaced wholesale.
- A file in the extending version containing ``deleted: true`` removes the
  inherited configuration entirely (e.g. for tables excluded from a demo
  dataset).

Bases may themselves extend other versions; chains are resolved recursively
and cycles are rejected. The identity (dataset, version, name) of every
resolved configuration always comes from the extending version's directory,
never from where a file physically lives.
