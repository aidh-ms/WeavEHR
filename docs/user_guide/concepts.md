# Concept configuration

The concept step turns dataset-specific event streams into **harmonised clinical concepts**. After this step, a heart rate is `heart_rate//bpm` regardless of whether it came from MIMIC's `chartevents` item 220045 or eICU's `vitalperiodic` table — so analysis code becomes dataset-agnostic.

Concepts are configured in two parts:

1. a **concept definition** — dataset-independent, shared by everyone (`configs/concepts/<category>/<name>.yml`), and
2. one **concept mapping per dataset** — how to find that concept in a specific dataset (`configs/datasets/<dataset>/<version>/mappings/<name>.yml`).

The two are connected by file name: when a concept named `heart_rate` is loaded, WeavEHR looks for `heart_rate.yml` in every directory listed under the step's `dataset_configs`.

## Step configuration

```yaml
name: Concept
version: 1.0.0

config:
  extraction_step: Extraction            # which step's output to read
  mapping_configs:
    - name: mimic-iv                     # dataset name used during extraction
      version: "3.1"
      path: /path/to/configs/datasets/mimic-iv/3.1/mappings/
    - name: eicu-crd
      version: "2.0"
      path: /path/to/configs/datasets/eicu-crd/2.0/mappings/
```

## Concept definitions

A concept definition is deliberately small:

```yaml
name: heart_rate
version: 1.0.0
unit: bpm
extension_columns:           # optional extra output columns
  dataset: col("dataset")    # provenance columns added automatically per row
  table: col("table")
```

The output code for every matched event becomes `<name>//<unit>` (e.g. `heart_rate//bpm`). For binary concepts like `antibiotics`, the bundled configs use `unit: boolean` with values mapped to `1`/`"true"`.

During processing, each row is annotated with `dataset`, `version`, `table`, and `event` columns describing where it came from; `extension_columns` chooses which of these (or any other [expression](expressions.md)) to keep in the output.

## Concept mappings

A mapping file declares its `type` — `simple`, `derived`, or `complex`.

### Simple concepts

Simple concepts select rows from the extraction output by matching event codes. Remember that extraction codes have the form `dataset//table//<code parts>`:

```yaml
type: simple
mappings:
  - pattern:
      table: chartevents        # which extraction output file to read
      event: CHART
      code: (220045//Heart Rate)   # regex matched against the code column
    columns:
      numeric_value: col(numeric_value)
      text_value: col(text_value)
    # filters:                     # optional row filters
    #   - col(numeric_value) > 0
```

- `pattern.table` and `pattern.event` locate the Parquet file(s) to read (omit `event` to scan all events of the table). The dataset and version are filled in automatically from the mapping file's location.
- `pattern.code` is a regular expression fragment matched against the full code, so alternations select multiple items at once: `(225792//Invasive Ventilation|225794//Non-invasive Ventilation)`. A fully custom regex can be given as `pattern.regex` instead.
- `columns.numeric_value` / `columns.text_value` are expressions evaluated on the matched rows; constants work too (`numeric_value: const(1)` for flag-style concepts).

A concept may have any number of mappings; their results are concatenated. See the bundled `antibiotics.yml` mappings for a larger real-world example combining prescriptions and infusions.

### Derived concepts

Derived concepts are computed **from other concepts** rather than from raw events. WeavEHR resolves the dependency graph automatically (topological ordering), so derived concepts can build on other derived concepts.

```yaml
type: derived
table:
  concept: <concept identifier>     # the primary input concept
  columns: [subject_id, time, numeric_value]
  callbacks: []                     # expressions applied to the input
join:                               # further concepts to join in
  - concept: <other concept identifier>
    columns: [subject_id, time, numeric_value]
    both_on: [subject_id, time]     # default join keys
    how: outer
event:                              # mapping to the output MEDS columns
  numeric_value: <expression>
filters: []
```

This is how composite scores or ratios (e.g. concepts that combine two measurements) are expressed declaratively.

### Complex concepts

When declarative YAML is not enough, a complex concept delegates to a Python callable referenced by dotted path:

```yaml
type: complex
concept_transformer: my_package.transformers.VentilationWindows
concepts:                           # dependencies, processed first
  - ventilation_start
  - ventilation_end
kwargs: {}                          # extra arguments for the transformer
```

The transformer is instantiated with the concept configuration and called with the `WeavEHRProject`, giving it full access to read prior outputs and write its own:

```python
class VentilationWindows:
    def __init__(self, concept, complex_config, **kwargs): ...
    def __call__(self, project: WeavEHRProject) -> None: ...
```

## Output layout

Each concept is written per dataset:

```
datasets/concept/data/<concept name>/<version>/<dataset>.parquet
```

with the standard MEDS columns (`subject_id`, `time`, `code`, `numeric_value`, `text_value`) plus the concept's extension columns. Cross-dataset analysis is then a matter of scanning the per-dataset files of the same concept.

## Adding a new concept

1. Define it in `configs/concepts/<category>/<your_concept>.yml` (name, version, unit).
2. For each dataset, find the relevant source codes — `datasets/extraction/metadata/codes.parquet` is your friend — and write a mapping in `configs/datasets/<dataset>/<version>/mappings/<your_concept>.yml`.
3. Re-run the concept step (with `overwrite: true`, or `includes` limited to your concept while iterating).
