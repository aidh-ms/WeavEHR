WeavEHR converts heterogeneous intensive care datasets — MIMIC-IV, eICU-CRD, NWICU, or your own institutional exports — into the standardised [MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds) (Medical Event Data Standard) format using declarative, versioned YAML configurations.

- **One concept, many datasets** — define clinical concepts once, map them per dataset, and run the same study code everywhere.
- **MEDS-native output** — Parquet event streams with full metadata, ready for the MEDS ecosystem.
- **Fully offline** — designed for sensitive medical data; nothing leaves your secure perimeter.
- **Fast and lightweight** — built on Polars lazy streaming; processes full MIMIC-IV on a laptop.
