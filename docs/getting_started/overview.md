# Package overview

WeavEHR is an open-source Python framework for extracting, preprocessing, and harmonising intensive care unit (ICU) time series data from diverse sources. It converts heterogeneous ICU datasets — public ones such as [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) and [eICU-CRD](https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd/), as well as custom institutional data — into the standardised [MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds) (Medical Event Data Standard) format.

## The problem

ICU research routinely needs the same clinical variables — heart rate, creatinine, norepinephrine doses, ventilation episodes — but every dataset stores them differently: different table layouts, item identifiers, units, and timestamp conventions. Studies therefore accumulate one-off, dataset-specific extraction scripts that are hard to validate, hard to reuse, and hard to reproduce. Tools like the R package [`ricu`](https://github.com/eth-mds/ricu) showed that a shared, dataset-agnostic concept dictionary solves this; WeavEHR brings that approach to the Python ecosystem and combines it with the MEDS output standard.

## The approach

WeavEHR separates *what* to extract from *how* to extract it:

- **Declarative YAML configurations** describe source tables, joins, events, and clinical concepts. They are versioned, carry stable identifiers, and are snapshotted into every output project for reproducibility.
- **A processing pipeline** of steps executes those configurations:
    1. The **extraction step** turns raw source tables into MEDS event streams, with codes that preserve full provenance (`mimic-iv//chartevents//220045//Heart Rate//bpm`).
    2. The **concept step** maps those dataset-specific codes onto shared clinical concepts (`heart_rate//bpm`), so downstream code is identical for every dataset.
- **MEDS-compliant output**: every step writes a self-contained MEDS dataset (Parquet data plus `dataset.json` and `codes.parquet` metadata).

See the [user guide](../user_guide/pipeline.md) for a detailed walk through the pipeline.

## Key properties

| Property | How WeavEHR achieves it |
| --- | --- |
| Reproducibility | Versioned configs with deterministic identifiers; merged config snapshot stored in each project |
| Privacy | Fully offline operation; no data ever leaves your machine |
| Performance | Polars lazy/streaming execution; full MIMIC-IV is processable on a 16–32 GB laptop |
| Extensibility | New datasets are pure YAML; custom transformation callbacks and complex concepts plug in via Python |
| Interoperability | MEDS v0.4+ output consumable by the wider MEDS tool ecosystem |

## Bundled configurations

The repository ships curated configurations under `configs/`:

- **Extraction configs** for MIMIC-IV 3.1, eICU-CRD 2.0 (full and demo), and NWICU 0.1.0.
- **A concept dictionary** of ~90 concepts across vital signs, blood gas, clinical chemistry, hematology, medications, neurological scores, respiratory parameters, fluid output, and demographics, with per-dataset mappings (most complete for MIMIC-IV).
